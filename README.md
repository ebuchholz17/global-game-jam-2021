Welcome!

You have stumbled upon the ruins of a great castle, its glory days 
long-past. You can feel the magic in the air. Your thoughts seem to 
have a certain... "tangibility" here. But focus on the task at hand!

Lost treasures await within if you can brave the dangers. But can 
you find the exit?
